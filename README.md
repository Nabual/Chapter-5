# Chapter-5:  Understanding the Widget Tree
### What I Learned
I learned about Flutter's widget hierarchy, which forms the foundation of its UI structure. Each Flutter app is built as a widget tree, where widgets are nested to define layouts and functionalities. I also explored the rendering process, which determines how widgets are drawn on the screen. Additionally, I studied the differences between StatelessWidget, which represents immutable widgets, and StatefulWidget, which allows dynamic updates during runtime.

### Achievement
I successfully created a multi-layered widget tree for a static UI, combining various widgets like containers, rows, columns, and text to design a well-structured interface.
